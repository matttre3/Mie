Welcome to Mie! Mie is a web application designed to simplify the process of determining if a piece of clothing suits your personal color palette through armocromia analysis.

## Project Status ‚ö†Ô∏è(IN PROGRESS)‚ö†Ô∏è ‚û°Ô∏è<a href="https://mie-phi.vercel.app/">Check live web app here!</a>‚¨ÖÔ∏è

Currently, the software is in its initial phase where it can perform its core function, which is to recognize colors from a photo and determine if the most prominent color belongs to an armochromatic color palette or not. In future developments, the goal is to add a test to detect the user's personal color palette.

## Project Description

Mie allows users to take photos of clothing items or upload images from online shops. It then analyzes the colors present in the image and provides the user with an armocromic palette, helping them determine whether the clothing item complements their personal color palette.

## Project Highlights

- **Armocromic Analysis**: Mie offers armocromic analysis to help users determine if a clothing item suits their personal color palette.

- **Photo Capture and Upload**: Users can either take photos of clothing items or upload images from online shops for analysis.

- **Color Palette Generation**: Mie generates an armocromic color palette based on the colors present in the uploaded image, providing users with insights into whether the clothing item aligns with their color palette.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Mie is built using React with TypeScript, utilizing features such as `useState`, `useEffect`, and `React Router`. Tailwind CSS is used for styling the interface.

- **Color Analysis**: For color analysis, Mie integrates npm packages such as color-diff and color-thief. These tools enhance the accuracy of armocromic analysis by detecting and analyzing colors within images uploaded by users.
